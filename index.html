        <p>“Do good work, and be good to work with. You can’t be one or the other, you have to be BOTH.”</p>
        <p>A mentor told me this once, and I work really hard to inspire others to do the same.</p>
        <p>I have been in the TV/film industry for over 12 years, and have done it all. For the past 8 years I have worked as a Camera Operator, Drone Operator and Camera Assistant for many long running shows with large crews. In addition to camera,
          I have
          worked in several departments along the way, including production coordination, art department/set building, directing, assistant directing, wardrobe, grip, electric and lighting. </p>
        <p>My incredibly positive attitude is often the glue that holds teams together. I bring an extremely hard work ethic to every job, am exceptionally organized, and take pride in everything that I do. I am an excellent leader, as well as a
          perpetual
          student. </p>
